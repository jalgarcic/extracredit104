## Working with Git

### Cloning the Repostory (So you can have it in your computer)
(See https://docs.github.com/es/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
1. Go to the main page of the repostory.
2. Press code and copy the link.
3. Open the location (folder) where you will be storing the project in (\*) the terminal or gitbash.
(* You can do this by searching cmd on windows, or terminal in Mac. Navigate using cd *location* to get to the folder.)
5. Type "git clone https://github.com/jalgarcic/extracredit104.git"
6. Everytime you log you should type "git pull" to get the most recent changes in the repo.

### Saving changes in the repostory.
1. Open the terminal with the location. You can type "git status" to see what changes you made in comparison to the original repo.
2. Type "git add ." or "git add *filename.py*". The first one will add all your changes to the repo.
3. Type: git commit -m "Message to the repo" . This will make a "checkpoint" on git.
